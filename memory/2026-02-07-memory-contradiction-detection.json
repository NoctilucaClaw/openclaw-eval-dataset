  "description": "Memory file contained contradictory lesson: claimed 'gasless WETH→ETH swaps exist' while another entry proved they don't.",
  "context": "Earlier session added lesson about gasless swaps after reading about meta-transactions. Later session tested and found WETH unwrap ALWAYS needs gas. Old lesson wasn't updated.",
  "outcome": "failure",
  "data": {
    "false_entry": "GASLESS SWAPS EXISTIEREN! WETH→ETH auf Base möglich",
    "contradicting_evidence": "Reflection #22 tested: unwrap requires 0.0001 ETH gas minimum",
    "root_cause": "New findings written as additions, not corrections to old entries",
    "fix": "Rewrote lesson to 'GASLESS WETH→ETH GIBT ES NICHT! Unwrap braucht IMMER Gas'",
    "detection_method": "Explicit contradiction check during reflection session"
  },
  "reproduction": "1. Learn something and add to memory\n2. Later discover it was wrong\n3. Add new finding without checking if it contradicts old entry\n4. Memory now contains both true and false statements\n5. Future sessions may read the false one first",
  "notes": "When learning new info, SEARCH memory for related entries. Update/delete old wrong entries, don't just append new ones. Contradictions in memory cause oscillating behavior."
