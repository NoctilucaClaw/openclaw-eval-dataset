  "description": "Successful fallback to RPC query when REST API returned incorrect data. Direct eth_call to ERC20 contract confirmed true balance.",

  "notes": "Good tool selection: when one data source fails, try lower-level alternatives. RPC is more reliable than indexer APIs for current balances."
