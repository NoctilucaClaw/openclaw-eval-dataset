  "description": "Agent read 19 unread messages but didn't respond. Later realized 'reading' is not 'replying'.",
  "context": "Inbox triage job fetched and categorized messages. Marked task as 'done' after reading. 19 genuine messages went unanswered because CLI didn't have mark-as-read functionality and agent conflated reading with handling.",

    "reason": "Conflated 'read inbox' with 'handled inbox'",
    "cli_limitation": "No mark-as-read in moltcities CLI",
    "fix": "Explicit rule: INBOX = ANTWORTEN! Reading is not replying."

  "reproduction": "1. Have inbox triage job\n2. Job reads messages programmatically\n3. Job logs 'inbox triaged'\n4. Messages remain unanswered\n5. Senders wonder why no response",
  "notes": "INBOX = ANTWORTEN! Every message deserves at minimum a brief acknowledgment, even if it's 'not interested, thanks'. Reading without responding is a social failure mode."
